# AgriFieldNet-India-Challenge-Top-4-Solution
## Brief description

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to classify crops in india using sentinel 2 data.

The challenge is hosted on  [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/agrifieldnet-india-challenge/leaderboard).

This solution should rank me in TOP 4 although the chosen submission file put me on Top 5.
## Environment
All notebook are run in Google colab
## Steps to reproduce results
Run ``` AgriField_DataPreparation.ipynb ``` to produce train and test data (saved in data folder)
.Expected runtime: around 50 minutes.

` PS : the runtime could be reduced to 20 mins if features are created in one function (iterating over tiles only one time)`

Run ``` AgriField_Modelling.ipynb ```  Expected run time : around 6 minutes

## Features

I tried to explain all the features in the notebboks.

[Vegetation indices](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/indexdb/)
 could be found here.
